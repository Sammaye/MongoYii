/**
 * EMongoCriteria
 *
 * Yes it is here but I am not sure why. I have made this incase it proves to more suitable to beginners with
 * MongoDB to have this class and whether it makes for better programming in general.
 *
 * My personal opinion is that MongoDB has a natural and easy to understand language that doesn't really require a
 * criteria class to build moduler queries from. Not only that but unlike SQL where you can form the entire query here
 * in MongoDB you still have to do tests to find out why limit and skip should truly be used since the Cursor is, of course,
 * an object.
 *
 * For these reasons this class is not relied on anywhere and can easily be taken out.
